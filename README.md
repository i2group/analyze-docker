# Analyze Docker

Welcome to the GitHub home page for the Docker image packaging for the official i2 images. The analyze-docker
repository provides Dockerfiles used in [Analyze Containers](https://github.com/i2group/analyze-containers)
which provide a reference architecture for creating a containerized deployment of i2 Analyze.

## Versioning

There are 3 type of versions that are supported in this project: stable, latest, unique. We attempt to follow [semver](https://semver.org/) as close to what our dependencies do.

To identify each Docker image version we use Docker tags with a naming convention for each type.

### Stable

Each stable versions/tags move with the most recent _distinct_ version release. This is the major and minor version when semver is followed.

Example 1: Solr `8` tag currently points to version `8.11.2`, later a build publishes version `8.11.3` so the `8` tag gets updated to point to the new fix pack update `8.11.3`.
Additionally, `8.11` tag was pointing to version `8.11.2` and got updated to point to `8.11.3`.

Example 2: Solr `8` tag currently points to version `8.11.3`, later a build publishes version `8.12.0` so the `8` tag gets updated to point to the new minor update `8.12.0`.
Additionally, `8.11` tag points to version `8.11.2` and a new tag `8.12` got created to point to `8.12.0`.

### Latest

The tag `latest` always points to the most recent release.

### Unique

These tags are useful for deployments since they don't move aka. once they are pushed they forever point to the same Docker image SHA.

Naming convention: `<stable_name>-<build_number>`

E.g. `8.11-234`

### Main (Dev only)

The tags with suffix `-main` are currently in development and not supported for production use.

## Image updates

There is a weekly scheduled build (Sun 00:00:00 UTC) which pulls latest patches of all dependencies for the images.

Given the nature of some images (hardcoded version + shasum), manual updates are required which are scheduled to be done monthly when necessary.

The list is as follows:

- Solr
- ZooKeeper
- Prometheus
